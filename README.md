# File Share
A simple python script that can be used to share files using a tcp protocol. add the file you want to share to the `send` folder, then run the `receiver.py` file in the `receive` folder. while it's running, run the `sender.py` file in the `send` folder and use the cli to choose your option and file. the file will be shared to the receiver and it'll also show a progress bar thingie in the console.
